- This is an official repository for the PLAT dataset from [LBox](https://lbox.kr/v2).
- The paper is available from [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03444).

[Released the dataset on the Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sma1-rmarud/PLAT)


# Datasets
PLAT is a dataset for predicting the legitimacy of additional tax penalties. It consists of high-quality precedents related with additional tax penalties.

We summarized it with GPT-o1(o1-2024-12-17) in two-way forms:

multiple-choice-test(laufulness : True/False)
essay-test(explain about laufulness)
- question is restructured to mimic the format of questions in the Korean tax accountant exam, incorporating case information, facts, and claims.
- answer consists of the judgeâ€™s reasoning and decision in the precedent.
- rubric is generated by GPT-o1 (o1-2024-12-17).

### How to load examples(mc)
Please refer to the explore_plat.ipynb file.
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from pprint import pprint

ds = load_dataset("sma1-rmarud/PLAT", "mc")

pprint(ds['test'])
print(f"case_no: {ds['test']['case_no'][0]}\n"
       f"plaintiff: {ds['test']['plaintiff'][0]}\n"
       f"defendant: {ds['test']['defendant'][0]}\n"
       f"facts: {ds['test']['facts'][0]}\n")
```
### How to load examples(essay)
Please refer to the explore_plat.ipynb file.
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = load_dataset("sma1-rmarud/PLAT", "essay")

pprint(ds['test'])
print(f"index: {ds['test']['index'][0]}\n"
       f"question: {ds['test']['question'][0]}\n"
       f"answer: {ds['test']['answer'][0]}\n"
       f"rubric: {ds['test']['rubric'][0]}\n")
